Flexible financial strategies help companies adapt effectively and profitably to unforeseen cash flow fluctuations or investment choices (Nguyen, Q. K., 2024). This dynamic approach to financial planning emphasizes the importance of flexibility and thorough preparation when facing financial challenges and opportunities. Therefore, financial flexibility is a critical consideration for companies.

Effective risk management of payments is essential for both shareholders and managers. It refers to an organization’s ability to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks to minimize potential negative impacts on its goals and operations (Nguyen, Q. K. & Dang, 2022b).

In the rapidly developing economic context of Vietnam—a burgeoning nation characterized by globalization, technological advancements, and dynamic market conditions—listed non-financial companies are striving to enhance their risk management effectiveness and adopt suitable flexible financial strategies to attract foreign investors. Research by Q.K. Nguyen and Dang (2022b) indicates that risk management efficiency in emerging markets remains low.

Using sample data from listed non-financial companies in Vietnam, this report examines the impact of effective payment risk management on the financial flexibility of companies in various sectors: Aviation & Logistics; Automotive Technology; Hospitality, Restaurants & Entertainment; Healthcare Equipment & Supplies; Food Technology; Pharmaceuticals; and Transportation. The findings reveal that effective payment risk management reduces financial flexibility. Additionally, the study explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial flexibility and finds a positive but insignificant effect on companies' flexible financial strategies.
