# 1. INTRODUCTION
- Flexible financial strategies help companies adapt effectively and profitably to unforeseen cash flow fluctuations or investment choices (Nguyen, Q. K., 2024). This dynamic approach to financial planning emphasizes the importance of flexibility and thorough preparation when facing financial challenges and opportunities. Therefore, financial flexibility is a critical consideration for companies.
- Effective risk management of payments is essential for both shareholders and managers. It refers to an organization’s ability to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks to minimize potential negative impacts on its goals and operations (Nguyen, Q. K. & Dang, 2022b).
- In the rapidly developing economic context of Vietnam—a burgeoning nation characterized by globalization, technological advancements, and dynamic market conditions—listed non-financial companies are striving to enhance their risk management effectiveness and adopt suitable flexible financial strategies to attract foreign investors. Research by Q.K. Nguyen and Dang (2022b) indicates that risk management efficiency in emerging markets remains low.
- Using sample data from listed non-financial companies in Vietnam, this report examines the impact of effective payment risk management on the financial flexibility of companies in various sectors: Aviation & Logistics; Automotive Technology; Hospitality, Restaurants & Entertainment; Healthcare Equipment & Supplies; Food Technology; Pharmaceuticals; and Transportation. The findings reveal that effective payment risk management reduces financial flexibility. Additionally, the study explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial flexibility and finds a positive but insignificant effect on companies' flexible financial strategies.

# 2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND OVERVIEW OF RELATED RESEARCH
## 2.1. Theoretical Foundation of Financial Flexibility
According to Hao et al. (2022), building on previous studies, financial flexibility refers to the efficient allocation of financial resources, strategic investment in assets during crises, and effective management of potential financial risks. This flexibility enables organizations to respond swiftly to external fluctuations and to raise or acquire additional financial assets to mitigate negative impacts. In unpredictable situations, financial flexibility plays a crucial role in adjusting a company’s strategy. It pertains to a business's ability to minimize risk and maximize financial resources in the face of unstable financial environments.
## 2.2. Theoretical Foundation of Effective Risk Management
Huang, J. (2023) emphasizes that effective risk management regarding liquidity and payment risks is essential for the long-term sustainability of any business. This includes identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks related to all aspects of an organization, entity, or company. Subsequently, it is necessary to harmoniously and economically apply financial resources to minimize, control, and monitor the impact and likelihood of unfortunate incidents. This is an ongoing process that requires businesses to implement comprehensive security measures to mitigate threats.
## 2.3. Overview of Related Studies on the Relationship between Effective Risk Management and Financial Flexibility
Nguyen, Q. K. (2024) argues that although financial flexibility strategies can provide several benefits for business management, some economic theories suggest that they may reduce the effectiveness of risk management in certain contexts. Furthermore, based on conclusions drawn from studies referenced in Nguyen’s research, companies with higher financial flexibility and sluggish financial resources exhibit greater investment inefficiencies, meaning these companies may engage in high-risk projects with low returns. Ali and Siddiqui (2020) also provide evidence that an excess of internal financial resources can lead to inefficient resource allocation, with funds invested in projects or investments that do not yield the best risk-adjusted returns. As a result, capital usage becomes suboptimal. Moreover, option theory suggests that managers often tend to accept high-risk projects with inconsistent expected returns due to personal interests (Q. K. Nguyen & Dang, 2022b). This implies that managers may select high-risk projects that yield low returns, leading to ineffective risk management, particularly in businesses with high free cash flow and significant cash reserves. Based on the theories and findings from prior research, the following hypothesis is proposed:

***H1: Effective risk management reduces financial flexibility.***

# 3. RESEARCH METHOLOGY
## 3.1. Research Model
Based on previous research and the foundational model established by Naseer, M. M. (2024) and Teng, X. (2021) regarding financial flexibility, the calculation formula is expressed as follows:

***Financial Flexibility (FF) = Cash Flexibility + Debt Flexibility***

In which:

- ***Cash Flexibility*** is the ability to utilize the company’s internal capital, calculated as Cash and Cash Equivalents / Total Assets.
- ***Debt Flexibility*** is the ability to obtain external financial resources, calculated as 1 – Debt Ratio / Total Assets.


With the objective of examining the impact of effective risk management on the financial flexibility of companies, the research model is expressed as follows:

***FFi,t = + 1D/Ei,t + 2QRi,t + 3SIZEi,t + 4ROAi,t + 5INFt + εit      (1)***

Additionally, to examine whether there is a difference in the impact of Covid-19 on financial flexibility, the testing model is as follows:

***FFi,t = + 1D/Ei,t + 2QRi,t + 3SIZEi,t + 4ROAi,t + 5SINDEXt + εit   (2)***

In which:

- ***D/Ei,t***: Debt-to-equity ratio, representing the percentage of capital that the company raises through borrowing compared to the capital invested by shareholders. It is an important tool for assessing the effectiveness of risk management.
- ***QRi,t***: Quick ratio, which assesses the company's ability to pay short-term liabilities using its most liquid assets.
- ***SIZEi,t***: Bank size, calculated using the natural logarithm of the bank's total assets. The logarithmic method standardizes the data to reduce variability among companies of different sizes.
- ***ROAi,t***: Return on assets, a measure of profitability per unit of assets for the company. ROA is commonly used as a measure of financial performance alongside ROE.
- ***INFt***: Inflation rate, indicating the rate of increase in the general price level of the economy, reflecting the level of inflation in the economy.
- ***SINDEXt***: Strictness index (SINDEX) to measure the severity of the Covid-19 crisis, calculated using the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker project. This data includes school closures; workplace closures; cancellation of public events; restrictions on public gatherings; halting public transport; stay-at-home orders; domestic travel restrictions; and international travel controls. The index is determined by taking the average score of these eight indicators, with each indicator assigned a value from 0 to 100, and then applying the natural logarithm to scale this variable (Nguyen, Q. K. (2023)).

***Fixed Effects Model (FEM) Regression Results***

- The FEM model tests the relationship between financial flexibility and effective risk management of payments, as well as the operational efficiency of companies during the period from 2014 to 2023. The regression results indicate that all independent variables are statistically significant in the model.
- As one of the tools for assessing the effectiveness of a company’s risk management, the Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E) measures a company's financial leverage by calculating the ratio of debt to equity. The regression results indicate that effective risk management has a significantly negative impact on financial flexibility (consistent with hypothesis H1). With a coefficient of -0.0121, it shows that a higher leverage ratio reduces the flexibility of both cash and debt by imposing fixed financial obligations, which limits the company’s cash management capabilities and reduces its ability to take on additional debt.
- The Quick Ratio (QR) evaluates a company's ability to meet short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets. With a positive coefficient of 0.0007 that is statistically significant in the model, a higher quick ratio implies greater cash flexibility. This also enhances the ability to utilize internal capital, allowing companies to meet immediate obligations without resorting to additional debt or liquidating assets.
- The regression results indicate that larger companies tend to have poorer financial flexibility. This can be attributed to larger firms potentially facing bureaucratic challenges and higher fixed costs, which diminish their ability to manage cash and adjust debt levels compared to smaller, more agile companies.
- The operational efficiency of the business, represented by Return on Assets (ROA), has a positive relationship with financial flexibility, with a p-value of 1.355e-14 indicating significant influence on the model outcomes. Higher profitability leads to increased internal cash generation, enhancing cash flexibility and allowing for better debt management.
- Additionally, the inflation rate, which measures overall price increases and the decrease in the purchasing power of money, negatively affects flexible financial strategies. With a coefficient of -0.004, it indicates that higher inflation reduces financial flexibility. Inflation increases operating costs and may diminish profit margins, constraining cash flexibility. It can also affect debt flexibility by raising interest rates and the nominal costs of debt repayment.

***Results of Multicollinearity Test for Variables in the Fixed Effects Model (FEM)***

- To ensure the significance of the independent variables in the model, a multicollinearity test was conducted. The results showed that all Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values for the independent variables were very close to 1, indicating that there is no significant correlation between these variables and others in the model, and there are no multicollinearity issues.

***Fixed Effects Model (FEM) Regression Results during the COVID-19 Pandemic***

- The FEM model tests the relationship between financial flexibility and effective risk management of payments, as well as the operational efficiency of companies during the period when the COVID-19 pandemic had the greatest impact on the economy. However, the regression results indicate that only 2 out of the 5 independent variables are significant in the model.
- The high coefficient assessing the effectiveness of risk management still reduces financial flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the D/E variable in Model (2) does not show significance, indicating that D/E is not sufficient to represent the effectiveness of risk management for companies during this time.
- The quick ratio in Model (2) is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.03866, showing that companies with better liquidity can more effectively navigate financial crises, maintain operations, and meet obligations with less stress.
- The size of the enterprise has an inverse effect on financial flexibility during this challenging period, due to the complexities and higher fixed costs associated with larger operations, making it more difficult to quickly adjust to economic shocks. However, the statistical significance of SIZE is not notable.
- Return on Assets (ROA) indicates how effectively a company uses its assets to generate profits. The positive coefficient suggests that higher profitability can enhance financial flexibility, as profitable companies have better internal resources to utilize. However, the lack of statistical significance implies that during the pandemic, profit alone is not a decisive factor for financial flexibility.
- The stringent index (SINDEX) measures the severity of the COVID-19 crisis and replaces the inflation index (INF), having a positive impact on financial flexibility. However, the insignificant results indicate that during the pandemic, the severity index does not have a clear effect on the financial flexibility of businesses.
- Based on the regression results of the two models above, it can be observed that the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant volatility in the economy and financial markets, leading to differences in the research model. Specifically, the risk management effectiveness indicator D/E and the operational efficiency indicator ROA no longer provide significance for financial flexibility in the years 2020 and 2021. This concludes that relying solely on D/E and ROA is insufficient to clarify the relationship between financial flexibility, risk management effectiveness, and operational efficiency during this period. Additionally, the severity index (SINDEX) also fails to explain financial flexibility during the crisis, suggesting the need for additional variables related to COVID-19 that may have a greater impact on financial flexibility.

### 4.2. Economic Significance
- The regression models assess the relationship between financial flexibility and effective risk management of payments, as well as the operational efficiency of companies in sectors such as Aviation & Logistics; Automotive; Hospitality; Restaurants & Entertainment; Healthcare Equipment & Supplies; Food Technology; Pharmaceuticals; and Transportation Infrastructure. This model spans before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic to clarify how these variables affect financial flexibility in a period when the national economy faces significant volatility after experiencing the global recession of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic.
- When addressing the dependence on internal capital and the acquisition of external financial resources (financial flexibility), the effectiveness of payment risk management must be considered. The D/E ratio reveals how companies balance their capital structure, indicating their reliance on debt versus shareholder equity. During economic instability, a high D/E ratio may signify higher vulnerability, as accumulated debt burdens can stress financial flexibility. Additionally, the quick ratio is also one of the measures of risk management effectiveness alongside D/E, but it is more commonly used to determine financial resilience than financial risk.
- The natural logarithm of total assets (SIZE) is included in the model to mitigate discrepancies, providing a standardized measure to evaluate institutional scale, as larger enterprises typically utilize more substantial resources, enhancing their ability to withstand market volatility. Furthermore, ROA is used as a tool to evaluate the operational efficiency of businesses instead of ROE because ROA highlights the ability to generate income from investments, reflecting operational effectiveness and significantly impacting the company's asset utilization.
- Inflation is also a crucial indicator in determining financial flexibility's dependence on macroeconomic variables, as inflationary pressures can influence cost structures and companies' financial maneuverability. During the COVID-19 crisis, the severity index captures the seriousness of government responses, ranging from mobility restrictions to economic shutdowns, which will inevitably impact financial conditions and the ability to utilize internal capital as well as external financial resources.
- By combining these variables, an economically meaningful model can be developed to assess the relationships and influences between risk management factors, business efficiency, and financial flexibility.
- However, the varying impacts of the pandemic across sectors suggest a nuanced context. It is evident that most businesses in affected industries must maintain financial flexibility even in disruptive contexts like the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring them to ensure high liquidity and manage risks prudently, particularly in sectors such as Aviation & Logistics and Transportation Infrastructure. The hospitality, restaurant, and entertainment sectors were among the hardest hit by COVID-19 due to lockdowns and travel restrictions. Companies with effective risk management, characterized by cautious debt management (low D/E) and ample liquidity (high QR), are more likely to endure extended closures and demonstrate robust recovery. However, size (SIZE) may pose challenges for larger hotel chains and entertainment conglomerates.
